Today I've got a crazy but marvelous idea; a program that can turn any image found on the web into a grid with a lot of related images, so that all small images together form the big pigture again. I'm not sure if this is gonna work but I really want to make this web based so (almost) anyone can use it. Probabely I'm gonna need some server side C++ stuff to speed up the process.
