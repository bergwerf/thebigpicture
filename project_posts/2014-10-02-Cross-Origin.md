Thanks to [this script](http://html5hub.com/exploring-color-matching-in-javascript/ "this script") I can now find the difference between two colors (Delta E) But as expected, I can't read the pixel data from the thumbnails my PHP program scraped from Google Images due to Cross-Orign data. Because I couldn'f find an appropriate solution on the internet, I wrote a small, server-side image proxy (not sure what Google thinks about that ;-)
