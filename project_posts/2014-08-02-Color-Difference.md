Recently I encountered a major problem; how to find the difference between two RGB colors (fast)?
This is not as easy as it seams because the visual color difference for the human eye is a little more complicated that just the distance between two points in RGB space. That's because the human eye color perception is not the same for every color as you can see in the image below.

There are multiple algorithms to calculate the difference between two colors (known as Delta E) for the human eye, fortunately I've found a [JavaScript implementation](http://html5hub.com/exploring-color-matching-in-javascript/ "JavaScript implementation").
