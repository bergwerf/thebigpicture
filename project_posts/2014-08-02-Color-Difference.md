I started writing the processing part of this project where I encountered a problem; how to find the difference between two RGB colors (fast)? The answer lies in the visual color differences. In other words; the human eye color perception is not the same for every color. There are multiple algorithms to calculate the difference between two colors for the human eye, but unfortunately I've found no JavaScript implementations yet.
