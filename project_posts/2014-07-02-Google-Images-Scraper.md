Image search via Google Images is a problem because Google only provides a paid or limited Custom Search API. Therefore I wrote a PHP based Google Images scraper today, using the [SimpleHTMLDOM Library](http://simplehtmldom.sourceforge.net/ "SimpleHTMLDOM Library").
I can now retrieve the image thumbnails from Google Images which is eneough for my application.
