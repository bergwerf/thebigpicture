I've been doing a lot of other stuff last month but I'm going to continue this project again! In order to find the right average color, I resize the thumbnails from Google Images to a 5x5 image. Then my program calculates the average Delta-E of all 25 pixels. The main image, which has to be filled with small images, is also resized so every new pixel can be matched with a thumbnail from Google. This routine works great and I've done some succesful tests already. A video is coming soon!
