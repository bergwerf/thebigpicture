I've been doing a lot of other stuff last month but I'm going to finish this project!
The most recent problem was finding the right average color. Now I've found the perfect way to do this:
- the thumbnails from Google Images are resized to a 5x5 image.
- my program calculates the average color of all 25 pixels.

The main image, which has to be filled with small images, is also resized so every pixel can be matched with a thumbnail from Google. The matching itself works using the Delta-E, there's another post about color difference, make sure to check it out!
