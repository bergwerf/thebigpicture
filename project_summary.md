## Description
A few times in my life, I've seen something very cool; an image mosaic, a large picture from a lot of smaller images. I want to combine this kind of art with Google Images using a JavaScript and PHP based webapp. This way, I want to show the wide variety of images found on Google and the artistic power of the computer. This is quite a challente because a lot of pictures have to be searched, processed and selected in order to find the right spot in the grid for the right picture. Moreover, this whole process should only take a reasonable bit of time.
