## Description
A few times in my life, I've seen somethink very cool; an image mosaic. A large picture built out of a lot of smaller pictures. I want to make this kind of art accessible to everyone. Therfore, I want to write a program which can turn an image found on the web into a mosaic of small, related images. To do this, a lot of pictures have to be searched, processed and selected in order to find the right spot in the grid for the right picture. Moreover, this whole process should only take a reasonable bit of time.
