## Description
A few times in my life, I've seen somethink very cool; a large picture built by a lot of smaller pictures. I want to make this kind of art accessible to everyone. Therfore, I want to make a program that can fill an image found on the web with a lot of related, small images, so that all small images together form the big pigture again. To do this, a lot of pictures have to be searched, processed and selected in order to find the right spot in the grid for the right picture. Moreover, this whole process should only take a reasonable bit of time.
