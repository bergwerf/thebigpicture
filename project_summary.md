## Description
A few times in my life, I've seen somethink very cool; a large picture built by a lot of smaller pictures. I want to make this kind of art accessible to everyone. Therfore, I want to make a program that can turn an image from an online image search engine like Google Images or Picasa into a grid of small, related pictures. TO do this, all pictures have to be processed and selected in order to find the right spot in the grid for the right picture at a reasonable speed.
