## Description
A few times in my life, I've seen somethink very cool; a large picture built by a lot of smaller pictures. I want to make this kind of art accessible to everyone. Therfore, I want to make a program that can turn an image from Google Images into a grid of small, related pictures. This is hard because all pictures have to be processed and selected in order to find the right spot in the grid for the right picture which also has to be done at a reasonable speed. Another problem is the image search, because Google only provides a paid or limited Custom Search API so the program will have to crawl the regular Google Image search.
