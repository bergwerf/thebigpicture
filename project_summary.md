# Picture Grid
One pictures from many

## Authors
- Herman Bergwerf

## Description
The idea of this project is to create a grid of pictures that, when zoomed out, form a new, larger picture. This grid is created from a Google Images search. The client can search and select one picture and the computer will fills this pictures with other, related pictures from Google Images. This is hard because all pictures have to be processed and selected in order to find the right spot for the right picture in the grid. This has to be done at a reasonable speed. Another problem is the image search because Google only provides a paid or limited Custom Search API so the program will have to crawl the regular Google Image search.
