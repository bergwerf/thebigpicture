One picture from many

## Description
A few times in my life, I've seen something very cool; an image mosaic, a large picture from a lot of smaller images. I want to combine this kind of art with Google Images using JavaScript and PHP. This way, I want to show the wide variety of images found on Google and the artistic power of the computer. This is quite a challente because a lot of pictures have to be searched, processed and selected in order to find the right spot in the grid for the right picture. Moreover, this whole process should only take a reasonable bit of time while we are using JavaScript and Google Chrome. If you want to know how it works, feel free to read the posts below!

Unfortunately I can't link to a live version of this project because the images are scraped from Google Search using PHP which is not really appreciated by Google :-(I could have used a Google API to retrieve images from Google Search but I haven't because it's paid service and I'm not that rich)
